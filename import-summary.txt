ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea\
* .idea\compiler.xml
* .idea\copyright\
* .idea\copyright\profiles_settings.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\vcs.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml
* COPYING.txt
* README.md
* Vector-Pinball.iml
* devnotes.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libgdx-box2d.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libgdx-box2d.so
* libs\armeabi\libgdx-box2d.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libgdx-box2d.so
* libs\gdx-box2d.jar => app\libs\gdx-box2d.jar
* libs\gdx.jar => app\libs\gdx.jar
* libs\x86\libgdx-box2d.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libgdx-box2d.so
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
